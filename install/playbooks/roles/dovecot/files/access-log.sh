# Log the IP addresses, the country and the client type on every connection
# The client type can be Roudncube, SOGo or IMAP
# This is using geoip free databases.
# The lines are going to this file:
#   /home/users/<user>/mails/security/connections.log
# Each line is as follow:
#   - date
#   - time
#   - unixtime
#   - IP
#   - country code
#   - Country
#   - source (SOGo / Roundcube / imap)
#   - status (OK / WARNING / DENIED)
#   - details (why the connection has been blocked or warned)
# Examples:
#   2019-04-15 20:24:25+01:00 1555356265 92.40.248.238 GB United_Kingdom Roundcube OK
#   2019-04-17 18:53:42+00:00 1555527222 199.249.230.112 US United_States imap DENIED \
#                             Access denied by Country policy checker
# When the country is not found, we use XX and "Neverland"
# The last field is used to check if a connection from this IP address has been done before.
# Possible implementations:
# - When the connection is new, the script can act differently, according to the user settings
# - An alert is sent by XMPP when a new IP address or country is used
# - Each user can set acceptable countries to connect from
# - A simple TFA can be provided from new IP addresses, using for instance google-authenticator and xmpp
# - Monthly reports per country, time, etc.
